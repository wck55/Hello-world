# Hello-world
My first repository 

I never had interest in computer programming when I was younger, as I got older I studied cisco networking and created wordpress blogg sites, but never really got to involved with languages until recently.
I started self studying Big Data, this made alot of scence to me how things on the web now works, so I want to learn more.
I started learning Python and recently started JS.
I want to learn more about the Hadoop system setting it up and running data into it.
